#### Notes

Road along the river through Chacely and Forthampton can have fast traffic not paying attention, cycle with caution.

There is a short stretch of the A46 at Northway/Ashchurch, this can be avoided by taking Aston Fields Lane before joining the A46 and then taking a left. 

Why not stop off and have a look at Croome Court (National Trust) and RAF Defford.
